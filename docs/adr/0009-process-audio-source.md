# ADR-0009: ProcessAudioSource (per-process loopback)

## Status

Accepted, 2026-05-02.

## Context

`WasapiLoopbackSource` (ADR-0007) captures the system default render endpoint. That is a great default: it just works and needs no permissions. But it has one user-visible weakness: **the visualization reacts to everything the user hears**, including Discord, browser tabs, music players, system notifications, and alt-tabbed apps. For a shader effect tied to *the game's* music, that bleed is the difference between an immersive effect and a distraction.

The user asked for source isolation. Three parallel research agents surveyed the industry; full notes are in [research-notes-process-audio.md](research-notes-process-audio.md). Summary:

- OBS Studio (28+), Streamlabs, and modern Discord builds all use `ActivateAudioInterfaceAsync` with `AUDIOCLIENT_PROCESS_LOOPBACK_PARAMS`, which is Microsoft's "Application Audio Capture" API, available on Windows 10 build 20348 (22H2) and Windows 11.
- NVIDIA Broadcast, Krisp, Voicemeeter, and VB-Cable ship signed virtual audio drivers and require manual per-app routing.
- Pre-2022 Discord and the original `bozbez/win-capture-audio` used DLL injection and IAT or inline hooks on `IAudioRenderClient`. Since 2022 they have all migrated away from that path.
- APOs (system-effect audio processing objects) see the endpoint mix, not per-process streams; they are the wrong layer for our problem.
- Media Foundation source readers consume files and capture devices, which is the wrong domain.

There is no second blessed Microsoft API for per-process audio buffers. Only metering data is exposed, via `IAudioMeterInformation`.

Listeningway's situation is unusually convenient: it is a ReShade addon, loaded as a DLL into the game's own process. The "find the game's PID, deal with launchers reparenting, watch child processes" complexity that out-of-process tools have to solve does not apply here. `GetCurrentProcessId()` is the target.

## Decision

Add a third `IAudioSource` implementation, `ProcessAudioSource`, alongside `WasapiLoopbackSource` and `OffSource`. Use Microsoft's process-loopback API targeting `GetCurrentProcessId()` with the process-tree-include mode.

### API path

```cpp
AUDIOCLIENT_ACTIVATION_PARAMS params = {};
params.ActivationType = AUDIOCLIENT_ACTIVATION_TYPE_PROCESS_LOOPBACK;
params.ProcessLoopbackParams.TargetProcessId      = GetCurrentProcessId();
params.ProcessLoopbackParams.ProcessLoopbackMode  =
    PROCESS_LOOPBACK_MODE_INCLUDE_TARGET_PROCESS_TREE;

PROPVARIANT activate_params = {};
activate_params.vt          = VT_BLOB;
activate_params.blob.cbSize = sizeof(params);
activate_params.blob.pBlobData = reinterpret_cast<BYTE*>(&params);

IActivateAudioInterfaceAsyncOperation* op = nullptr;
ActivateAudioInterfaceAsync(VIRTUAL_AUDIO_DEVICE_PROCESS_LOOPBACK,
                            __uuidof(IAudioClient), &activate_params,
                            completion_handler, &op);
```

The `IActivateAudioInterfaceCompletionHandler` posts back to a Win32 event; the source's main thread waits on the event with a timeout, then proceeds. This matches the OBS-tested pattern.

### Hardcoded format

`GetMixFormat` and `IsFormatSupported` return `E_NOTIMPL` on the virtual device returned by process loopback. Format must be hardcoded:

```cpp
WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE want = {};
want.Format.wFormatTag           = WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE;
want.Format.nChannels            = 2;
want.Format.nSamplesPerSec       = 48000;
want.Format.wBitsPerSample       = 32;
want.Format.nBlockAlign          = 8;          // 2 ch x 32-bit
want.Format.nAvgBytesPerSec      = 48000 * 8;
want.Format.cbSize               = sizeof(WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE) - sizeof(WAVEFORMATEX);
want.Samples.wValidBitsPerSample = 32;
want.dwChannelMask               = KSAUDIO_SPEAKER_STEREO;
want.SubFormat                   = KSDATAFORMAT_SUBTYPE_IEEE_FLOAT;
```

The audio engine resamples, requantizes, and downmixes internally to fit. This is the OBS-tested format and it is safe in 2026.

### Stream flags

```cpp
constexpr DWORD kStreamFlags =
    AUDCLNT_STREAMFLAGS_LOOPBACK |
    AUDCLNT_STREAMFLAGS_EVENTCALLBACK;
```

Event mode works for process loopback (unlike system loopback, where `EVENTCALLBACK | LOOPBACK` is documented broken: the event never fires). Process loopback uses a different code path through `ActivateAudioInterfaceAsync`, and event mode is the OBS-tested path.

### State machine

```
Initialized → Starting → Capturing → Stopping → Stopped
                            │
                            └─→ Error (re-activate on next start())
```

Reject `stop()` unless `Capturing`; reject `start()` unless `Stopped` or fresh `Initialized`. This mitigates the rapid Start/Stop race documented in [MS Q&A 1036316](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1036316/).

### Robustness

- SEH-wrap `GetBuffer`. Alt-tab from exclusive-fullscreen can crash inside `GetBuffer`. On an access-violation exception, tear down and re-activate.
- Watchdog. Every 60 seconds or so, verify that `u64DevicePosition` from `GetBuffer` advances. If stalled, force re-activation. This mitigates the 60-minute drift bug (OBS issues #8064 and #8086).
- Honour `AUDCLNT_BUFFERFLAGS_SILENT`. When set, push zero samples to the pipeline rather than possibly-stale memory.

### Source registration

```cpp
g_system->register_source(std::make_unique<lw::source::WasapiLoopbackSource>());  // order = 0
g_system->register_source(std::make_unique<lw::source::ProcessAudioSource>());    // order = 1
g_system->register_source(std::make_unique<lw::source::OffSource>());             // order = 100
```

`ProcessAudioSource::info()`:

```cpp
{
    .code = "process",
    .display = "Game Audio Only (Process Loopback)",
    .is_default = false,                  // System remains the default
    .order = 1,
    .activates_capture = true,
}
```

### Availability

`available()` returns true when both:

1. Windows 10 build is 20348 or higher (`RtlGetVersion` from `ntdll.dll`).
2. `ActivateAudioInterfaceAsync` resolves at runtime via `GetProcAddress` on `MMDevApi.dll`.

If unavailable, the dropdown still shows the option but disabled, with a tooltip: *"Requires Windows 10 22H2 (build 20348+) or Windows 11."*

If `available()` returns true but `open()` fails (corner cases like the 22H2 process-tree bug), `AudioSystem` falls back through its existing state-machine error path; the user sees the error and can re-pick `system`.

## Consequences

### Positive

- True isolation. The visualization tracks the game's audio only. Discord, the browser, the music app, and system notifications all become invisible. This is what users have been asking for.
- No driver install. Unlike NVIDIA Broadcast, VB-Cable, or Voicemeeter, there is no installer, no signed-driver rollout, no UAC prompt.
- No anti-cheat exposure. `ActivateAudioInterfaceAsync` against our own PID is invisible to anti-cheat: no `OpenProcess`, no memory reads, no DLL injection beyond what ReShade already does. FFXIV ships no anti-cheat anyway, but this is portability-friendly.
- The in-process advantage carries the design. `GetCurrentProcessId()` is the target, so none of the OBS-grade complexity around discovering the right PID, watching launchers, or handling separate audio child processes applies. The addon is loaded inside the game already, and `INCLUDE_TARGET_PROCESS_TREE` covers any child renderers.
- The adapter pattern is reused. The source layer was designed for exactly this (ADR-0003): a new source slots in without touching the ring, DSP, snapshot, or output layers.

### Negative

- OS floor. Windows 10 prior to build 20348 (22H2 update) and all Windows 11 builds prior to 21H2 cannot use this source. Mitigation: graceful disable plus tooltip; `system` remains the default.
- Hardcoded format. Per-device sample-rate awareness is gone for this source, since the engine handles conversion. In practice this is a non-issue: 48 kHz, float, stereo is a near-universal target.
- Documented edge cases: alt-tab from exclusive-fullscreen, 60-minute drift, rapid Start/Stop. Each has a mitigation; none has been a user-blocking issue in OBS's deployed base since 2022.
- One more source to test. Replay tests don't cover the source layer (they hit `FileSource`); manual in-game verification covers `ProcessAudioSource`.

### Neutral

- Latency is in the same ballpark as system loopback (around 20 ms), per OBS measurements. No noticeable change for the visualization.
- CPU cost is negligible. The audio engine does the per-process mixing and conversion in `audiodg.exe`; we just consume the result.

## Alternatives considered

### Bundle a virtual audio driver (VB-Cable or similar)

Rejected. We cannot redistribute VB-Cable (the licence forbids bundling). Building our own driver pair is an order of magnitude more complex than the entire v2 engine, requires WHQL signing, and introduces a per-machine install. Power users who want this on older OSes can install VB-Cable themselves; we will mention it in user docs as a fallback and nothing more.

### DLL hooking the game's `IAudioRenderClient`

Rejected. Anti-cheat heuristics flag IAT and inline hooks on COM v-tables. Even though Listeningway is already injected via ReShade, adding hooks on top still trips heuristics for online games (EAC, BattlEye, Vanguard, Ricochet). Worse than `PROCESS_LOOPBACK` when the latter works.

### APOs

Rejected. Endpoint-only. Wrong layer for per-process isolation.

### Media Foundation source reader

Rejected. Consumes files and capture devices, not other-process render streams. Wrong API for the problem.

### Replace `WasapiLoopbackSource` with `ProcessAudioSource`

Rejected. The OS floor would lock out Windows 10 prior to 22H2 entirely. Both sources should ship and the user picks. `system` remains the default because it has no OS floor.

### `IAudioMeterInformation` peak gating

Deferred to a separate PR. Per-session peak metering is metering only; there is no raw audio buffer. It can serve as a "game has audio" pre-gate for the system-loopback path, suppressing analysis when the game is silent on older OSes. Useful and complementary, but orthogonal to ProcessAudioSource. Tracked separately.
