# Architecture Decision Records

This directory holds the architectural decisions that govern the Listeningway v2 engine rebuild. Each ADR captures a single decision point: the context that forced the decision, the choice made, the consequences, and the alternatives considered.

ADRs are immutable once accepted. Superseding decisions get a new ADR that references the old one rather than editing in place.

## Format

ADRs follow [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) structure:

```
# ADR-NNNN: Title

## Status        Proposed | Accepted | Superseded by ADR-XXXX | Deprecated
## Context       what's forcing the decision
## Decision      what we chose
## Consequences  positive, negative, neutral
## Alternatives  what we considered and rejected
```

## Reading order for new contributors

If you're new to the project, read in numerical order. ADR-0001 sets the strategic context; ADR-0002 sets the structural foundation; ADRs 0003 through 0006 are the design rules that follow from it; ADR-0007 is the build plan; ADR-0008 is the toolchain.
