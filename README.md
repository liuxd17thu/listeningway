Listeningway is a ReShade addon that listens to system or per-game audio, analyzes it in real time, and publishes the results to anything that wants to react: ReShade shaders as annotation-bound uniforms, generative-art and VJ tools over OSC, and RGB peripherals through OpenRGB. One audio capture, three output channels, all toggleable from the in-game overlay.

> v2.x is in beta. Shader uniform names are committed against breakage. Coming from v1? The v1 uniforms still work; new ones are additive. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the migration notes.

---

## Quick start

You need ReShade 6.3.3 or newer (API 14+) on Windows 10 or 11. AuroraShade R10 is compatible.

1. Download the latest release from [the releases page](https://github.com/gposingway/Listeningway/releases/latest). The ZIP contains `Listeningway.addon`, `Listeningway.fx`, and `ListeningwayUniforms.fxh`.
2. Drop the files in:

   | File                       | Where                                                                                               | Why                                                           |
   | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `Listeningway.addon`       | Game folder, next to your ReShade DLL (`dxgi.dll`, `d3d11.dll`, ...). Not inside `reshade-shaders`. | ReShade loads `.addon` files from the same folder as the DLL. |
   | `Listeningway.fx`          | `reshade-shaders\Shaders\`                                                                          | Reference shader showing all uniforms in use.                 |
   | `ListeningwayUniforms.fxh` | `reshade-shaders\Shaders\`                                                                          | Header to `#include` from your own shaders.                   |

3. Launch the game and open the ReShade overlay. The **Listeningway** panel appears. Pick a source from the dropdown, then enable `Listeningway.fx` to see it react.

That's the whole setup for shader use. OSC and OpenRGB integrations are off by default; flip them on in the overlay's **Integrations** section when you want them.

## What it drives

### ReShade shaders

Include the generated header and read the uniforms you want.

```hlsl
#include "ReShade.fxh"
#include "ListeningwayUniforms.fxh"

float4 PS_AudioReactive(float4 pos : SV_Position, float2 uv : TEXCOORD) : SV_Target
{
    float bass_pulse = saturate((Listeningway_BassNorm - 0.8) * 2.0);
    float beat_flash = Listeningway_Beat;

    float3 c = tex2D(ReShade::BackBuffer, uv).rgb;
    c += float3(1.0, 0.4, 0.1) * bass_pulse * 0.3;
    c += beat_flash * 0.2;
    return float4(saturate(c), 1.0);
}

technique AudioReactive {
    pass { VertexShader = PostProcessVS; PixelShader = PS_AudioReactive; }
}
```

A few uniforms worth knowing:

| Uniform                                                   | What it is                                                              | When you'd reach for it                                                                                                               |

| `listeningway_volume_att`                                 | Smoothed `volume_norm` (asymmetric attack/release)                      | When you want the AGC value but not the jitter.                                                                                       |

| `listeningway_phase_volume`, `phase_bass`, `phase_treble` | Energy-accumulator phase, [0, 1)                                        | BPM-independent phase: a "loudness counter" that advances faster when the music is louder. Useful where `beat_phase` falls back to 0. |

The full uniform registry, including stability tier (Stable vs Experimental), lives in [STABILITY.md](STABILITY.md). That document is the public API contract.

## What it integrates with

Listeningway can mirror its analysis out to other tools over the wire. Both integrations are off by default and toggle from the overlay's **Integrations** section.

### OSC (TouchDesigner, Resolume, Max/MSP, vvvv, ...)

Flip the **OSC** toggle. The default destination is `127.0.0.1:9000` (TouchDesigner's default OSC In port). OSC addresses mirror the shader uniforms under a `/listeningway/` prefix; for example `/listeningway/volume`, `/listeningway/freqbands`, `/listeningway/beat`.

To verify the stream, run the bundled receiver:

```
python samples/osc_receiver.py
```

It listens on `127.0.0.1:9000` and prints every message it sees.

Full address schema, settings, integration recipes for popular hosts, and limitations are in **[docs/osc.md](docs/osc.md)**.

### OpenRGB (RGB peripherals)

Install [OpenRGB](https://openrgb.org), enable its SDK server (**Settings → SDK Server → Enable Server**), and flip the **OpenRGB** toggle in the overlay. Default destination `127.0.0.1:6742`.

The default mapping paints all LEDs as a spectrum-driven gradient (bass → blue, treble → red), modulated by AGC volume and beat flash. It's opinionated rather than configurable in v1, so plugging in a new device works out of the box.

Prerequisites, the full mapping math, failure-mode behavior, and limitations are in **[docs/openrgb.md](docs/openrgb.md)**.

---

## Pick an audio source

The overlay has a single **Audio Source** dropdown:

- **System Audio (WASAPI Loopback)** is the default. Captures everything you hear on the default playback device. Works on Windows 10 and 11.
- **Game Audio Only (Process Loopback)** captures the host process only, so Discord, browsers, and music apps stop bleeding into the visualization. Requires Windows 10 22H2 (build 20348+) or Windows 11; the option is grayed on older builds. Design notes in [ADR-0009](docs/adr/0009-process-audio-source.md).
- **None (Off)** disables analysis completely.

You can change the source at any time from the overlay.

---

## Configure

The overlay is the primary UI. Each section has a Settings disclosure on the right; engineer-only knobs hide behind an Advanced sub-disclosure inside it. Save with the **Save** button at the bottom; settings persist to `Listeningway.json` next to the addon. Editing the JSON by hand is fine; restart the game to apply.

Trimmed `Listeningway.json` example:

```jsonc
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "audio": {
    "analysis_enabled": true,
    "capture_source_code": "system", // "system" | "process" | "off"
    "pan_smoothing": 0.1,
  },
  "frequency": {
    "band_count": 64,
    "fft_size": 2048,
    "band_scale": "Mel", // "Linear" | "Log" | "Mel"
    "log_strength": 0.1,
    "min_freq": 30.0,
    "max_freq": 22050.0,
    "equalizer_bands": [1.11, 1.29, 2.11, 1.8, 1.63],
  },
  "beat": {
    "pulse_strength": 1.0, // single user-facing knob; 0..3
  },
  "agc": { "window_seconds": 5.0, "clamp_max": 4.0 },
  "loudness": { "window_ms": 400.0 },
  "network": {
    "osc": {
      "enabled": false,
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 9000,
      "rate_hz": 60,
    },
    "openrgb": {
      "enabled": false,
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 6742,
      "rate_hz": 30,
    },
  },
}
```

V1 configurations are not migrated; v2 writes a fresh file with v2 defaults on first run.

## Hacking on Listeningway

If you want to add a new audio source, DSP stage, output consumer, or shader uniform, start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the source layout, build, and code style. Architectural rationale lives in [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/); read in numerical order if you're touching anything cross-cutting. The five-layer pipeline (Source → Ring → DSP → Snapshot → Consumers) is in [ADR-0002](docs/adr/0002-pipeline-architecture.md); the adapter usage policy in [ADR-0003](docs/adr/0003-adapter-usage-policy.md); the configuration system in [ADR-0004](docs/adr/0004-configuration-strategy.md); the `IOutputConsumer` abstraction in [ADR-0010](docs/adr/0010-network-outputs.md).

## Credits

The wire-layer libraries for the OSC and OpenRGB consumers are vendored under [`third_party/`](third_party/) with their licenses and full attribution. They're the reason those integrations exist:

- **OSC**: [`mhroth/tinyosc`](https://github.com/mhroth/tinyosc) by **Martin Roth**, ISC-licensed. Two-file C99 OSC encoder; Listeningway uses the encoder side and brings its own Winsock plumbing. Detail in [`third_party/tinyosc/ATTRIBUTION.md`](third_party/tinyosc/ATTRIBUTION.md).
- **OpenRGB**: [`Youda008/OpenRGB-cppSDK`](https://github.com/Youda008/OpenRGB-cppSDK) by **Jan Broz**, MIT-licensed. The serious C++ client for the OpenRGB protocol; handles protocol-version negotiation correctly so Listeningway doesn't have to. Builds on Youda008's [`CppUtils-Essential`](https://github.com/Youda008/CppUtils-Essential) and [`CppUtils-Network`](https://github.com/Youda008/CppUtils-Network) libraries (also MIT).
