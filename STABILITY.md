# Listeningway: Shader uniform stability contract

This document is the public API contract for shader authors. Each uniform `source` string below has a stability classification and a "since" version:

- **Stable**. The name and semantic range are guaranteed not to change in any v2.x release. A v3 schema break would be announced in a new ADR and given a deprecation period. Safe to depend on.
- **Experimental**. The name is fixed but the semantic (range, scaling, edge-case behavior) may evolve during the v2 beta. Once a beta cycle validates the semantic, the uniform graduates to Stable.

Not listed here = not a contract. Anything else found by spelunking (internal helpers, debug fields) can change without notice.

The full uniform-name registry lives in [`src/output/shader_contract.h`](src/output/shader_contract.h). The publish logic lives in [`src/output/uniform_publisher.cpp`](src/output/uniform_publisher.cpp).

ReShade resolves `source` annotations at effect load. Reference shape:

```hlsl
uniform float Listeningway_Volume    < source = "listeningway_volume";    >;
uniform float Listeningway_FreqBands[64] < source = "listeningway_freqbands"; >;
```

## Uniforms

| Source string | Type | Range / units | Since | Stability | Semantic |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `listeningway_volume` | `float` | [0, 1] | v1 | Stable | Mean-absolute amplitude × volume amplifier, clamped. Snappy reactivity. |
| `listeningway_volumeleft` | `float` | [0, 1] | v1 | Stable | RMS of left channel (or downmix). |
| `listeningway_volumeright` | `float` | [0, 1] | v1 | Stable | RMS of right channel. |
| `listeningway_audiopan` | `float` | [-1, +1] | v1 | Stable | Stereo / surround pan. -1 = full left, +1 = full right. |
| `listeningway_audioformat` | `float` | {0, 1, 2, 6, 8} | v1 | Stable | Channel count as float. 0 = no audio. |
| `listeningway_freqbands` | `float[N]` | [0, 1] each | v1 | Stable | Post-EQ frequency band amplitudes. N = `listeningway_numbands`. |
| `listeningway_numbands` | `float` | [8, 128] | v1 | Stable | Live band count published. Cap is `kMaxBands` (128). |
| `listeningway_beat` | `float` | [0, 1] | v1 | Stable | Continuous pulse curve. Each detected onset attacks instantly to a strength in [0, 1] (graded by how loudly the onset stood out from its band's recent baseline) and decays exponentially with a ~150 ms time constant. Replaces the v1 binary spike-and-linear-decay behaviour; the numerical range is unchanged. |
| `listeningway_timeseconds` | `float` | seconds | v1 | Stable | Wall-clock seconds since addon load. |
| `listeningway_timephase60hz` | `float` | [0, 1) | v1 | Stable | `fmod(t * 60, 1)`. |
| `listeningway_timephase120hz` | `float` | [0, 1) | v1 | Stable | `fmod(t * 120, 1)`. |
| `listeningway_totalphases60hz` | `float` | seconds × 60 | v1 | Stable | Cumulative phase count at 60 Hz. |
| `listeningway_totalphases120hz` | `float` | seconds × 120 | v1 | Stable | Cumulative phase count at 120 Hz. |
| `listeningway_direction8` | `float[8]` | [0, 1] each | v1 | Stable | 8-bucket spatial intensity. Order: F, FR, R, BR, B, BL, L, FL. |
| `listeningway_front` | `float` | [0, 1] | v1 | Stable | direction8[0]. |
| `listeningway_front_right` | `float` | [0, 1] | v1 | Stable | direction8[1]. |
| `listeningway_right` | `float` | [0, 1] | v1 | Stable | direction8[2]. |
| `listeningway_back_right` | `float` | [0, 1] | v1 | Stable | direction8[3]. |
| `listeningway_back` | `float` | [0, 1] | v1 | Stable | direction8[4]. |
| `listeningway_back_left` | `float` | [0, 1] | v1 | Stable | direction8[5]. |
| `listeningway_left` | `float` | [0, 1] | v1 | Stable | direction8[6]. |
| `listeningway_front_left` | `float` | [0, 1] | v1 | Stable | direction8[7]. |
| `listeningway_volume_norm` | `float` | [0, ~4] | v2 | Stable | AGC-normalized volume. 1.0 = recent average; >1 = loud, <1 = quiet. Clamped at `agc.clamp_max`. |
| `listeningway_volume_att` | `float` | [0, ~4] | v2 | Stable | Time-attenuated `volume_norm` (asymmetric attack/release). |
| `listeningway_bass_norm` | `float` | [0, ~4] | v2 | Stable | AGC-normalized bass-band energy (lowest band-third). |
| `listeningway_mid_norm` | `float` | [0, ~4] | v2 | Stable | AGC-normalized mid-band energy. |
| `listeningway_treb_norm` | `float` | [0, ~4] | v2 | Stable | AGC-normalized treble-band energy. |
| `listeningway_bass_att` | `float` | [0, ~4] | v2 | Stable | Time-attenuated `bass_norm`. |
| `listeningway_mid_att` | `float` | [0, ~4] | v2 | Stable | Time-attenuated `mid_norm`. |
| `listeningway_treb_att` | `float` | [0, ~4] | v2 | Stable | Time-attenuated `treb_norm`. |
| `listeningway_freqbands16` | `float[16]` | [0, 1] each | v2 | Stable | 16-band reduction of `freqbands` (averaged buckets). |
| `listeningway_freqbands32` | `float[32]` | [0, 1] each | v2 | Stable | 32-band reduction of `freqbands`. |
| `listeningway_spectral_centroid` | `float` | [0, 1] | v2 | Stable | Magnitude-weighted spectral center, normalized to Nyquist. Useful for "brightness" / color-temperature shaders. |
| `listeningway_loudness` | `float` | [0, 1] | v2 | Experimental | K-weighted (BS.1770) momentary loudness over `loudness.window_ms` (default 400 ms), linear sqrt of mean-square. Output is linear, not LUFS log; a separate `_lufs` log uniform may be added if asked. |
| `listeningway_beat_phase` | `float` | [0, 1) | v2 | Experimental | Forward-predicted beat phase: time-to-next-beat divided by beat period, so the value counts down smoothly between detected beats. Falls back to 0 when tempo isn't locked. Use `tempo_confidence` to gate. (As of 2.0.0-beta.3 this is a sub-hop forward prediction from BTrack's `predictBeat`, not a v1-style PLL phase.) |
| `listeningway_tempo_bpm` | `float` | BPM | v2 | Experimental | Detected tempo, in [80, 160] BPM. 0 if undetected. Internally smoothed by a 41-state Viterbi over the comb-filterbank tempo posterior; chronotensity phases remain a more stable choice when tempo isn't locked. |
| `listeningway_tempo_confidence` | `float` | [0, 1] | v2 | Experimental | aubio-style parabolic-peak / sum on the comb-filterbank tempo observation vector. Typical locked-content readings sit ~0.05–0.30 (replaces the v1 `1 - second_best/best` measure that pinned at ~0.20 even on metronomic content). `tempo_detected` becomes true above 0.05. |
| `listeningway_phase_volume` | `float` | [0, 1) | v2 | Experimental | Chronotensity phase: accumulates `1.0 + k·(volume_norm-1)` Hz mod 1.0. Stable replacement for `beat_phase` when tempo isn't locked. |
| `listeningway_phase_bass` | `float` | [0, 1) | v2 | Experimental | Chronotensity phase driven by `bass_norm`. |
| `listeningway_phase_treble` | `float` | [0, 1) | v2 | Experimental | Chronotensity phase driven by `treb_norm`. |
| `listeningway_volume_history` | `float[64]` | [0, 1] each | v2 | Experimental | Last 64 frames of `volume`, oldest at index 0. Enables waterfall/trail effects without shader-side ring buffers. |
| `listeningway_freqbands_history` | `float[N*32]` where N = DEFAULT_NUM_BANDS | [0, 1] each | v2 | Experimental | Last 32 frames of the post-EQ band amplitudes at native resolution. Layout: **band-major**, time-ascending. Index helper: `freqbands_history[band * 32 + frame]`. `frame=0` is oldest, `frame=31` is newest. Band axis matches `listeningway_freqbands` / `listeningway_numbands`. At runtime the addon writes `numbands * 32` entries; the remaining uniform tail is whatever was last written. ~8 KB uniform read at the default 64 bands. Frame count was reduced from 64 to 32 in 2.0.0-beta.3 so the array fits inside the D3D11 constant-buffer cap (max 4096 float4 slots) alongside the rest of the Listeningway uniforms; shaders that want a longer trail can sample more sparsely or roll their own ring buffer. |

## Compatibility guarantees

- **v1 → v2:** every uniform marked `Since: v1` above continues to work. Some semantics may be tuned (better tempo tracker, AGC-aware behavior), but the numerical range is preserved.
- **v2.x → v2.y (minor):** Stable uniforms are byte-compatible. Experimental uniforms may have semantic changes; CHANGELOG will call them out.
- **v2 → v3 (major):** breaking changes published as a new ADR superseding ADR-0005. Listeningway aims to avoid this for at least one release cycle.

If a shader you maintain uses an Experimental uniform and you want it graduated to Stable, file an issue. That's the signal that drives promotion.

## How to add a new uniform

1. Add a new `kFoo = "listeningway_foo"` line to [`src/output/shader_contract.h`](src/output/shader_contract.h).
2. Add the source field to [`AudioSnapshot`](src/audio/snapshot/audio_snapshot.h) (must remain trivially copyable).
3. Add a publish step to [`src/output/uniform_publisher.cpp`](src/output/uniform_publisher.cpp).
4. Add a `value_or` projection in [`AudioSystem::dsp_thread_main`](src/audio/pipeline/audio_system.cpp) so the snapshot field gets populated from the DSP pipeline.
5. Update this STABILITY.md.

The compile-time string-view match in `uniform_publisher.cpp` will fail with a missing-symbol error if you reference a constant that doesn't exist in `shader_contract.h`.
